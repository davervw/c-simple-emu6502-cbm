# M5Core C64 #

Work in progress.  Current state includes rendering full color screen on M5Core LCD and supporting multiple Core models with a define change in M5Core.h.  60 times a second IRQ implemented to blink cursor.   

No input for now (will be adding keyboard).
SD support not integrated yet (should be simple).
