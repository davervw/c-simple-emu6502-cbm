# M5Core C64 #

***For BETTER support see [M5 branch](https://github.com/davervw/c-simple-emu6502-cbm/tree/m5) supporting CoreFireIoT,CoreS2,CoreS3 which have extra RAM for D64 and C128 support.  Also see [master branch](https://github.com/davervw/c-simple-emu6502-cbm/tree/master) for list of supported platforms.***

This is a static snapshot of the m5 project supporting a Basic Core without SD/D64/C128 support, features include rendering full color screen on M5Core LCD and supporting multiple Core models with a define change in M5Core.h.  

Open browser-keyscan-helper/index.html to run an adapter with instructions how to use a keyboard via serial from a desktop web browser (e.g. Chrome). 

SD support not integrated in this branch due to implementation requiring extra RAM not present in Basic Core.
